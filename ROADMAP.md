# SPHERES Roadmap

## Done (v0.5 rebuild)
- Deterministic core, save/load, monthly ticks, state hashing
- Economy: growth/catchup/diminishing returns, inflation, budgets/debt, oil market, bubbles+hangover
- War: coalitions, exhaustion, annexation vs subjugation, burned-hand learning, nuclear taboo
- Politics: central bank AI, fiscal AI, elections, USSR dissolution, 1998 proliferation
- Oil embargo: sanctions cut *exports* via `oil_export_share`, hitting the producer's
  revenue and budget, not just a GDP drag; embargoes outlast their war and lift as
  grievance decays (Iraq's runs ~10y, against the historical 1990-2003)
- Negotiated peace: ceasefire and territorial concession, not only white peace
- Yugoslavia + successor states — the breakup and its wars emerge from separatism
- Roster expansion: Brazil, Indonesia, Egypt, Israel, Turkey, Nigeria, Vietnam, and
  Ukraine as a USSR successor alongside Russia. 24 at the start, up to 30 after
  federations come apart
- Browser UI: map, charts, league table, dispatch feed, readable history
- **Technology tree**: 253 technologies across eight domains plus a foundation set.
  Research funded out of output, spent across domains, diffusion weighted by GDP
  and openness, unlocks gated by prerequisites and year floors
- **Productivity rebuilt on the tree**: the tree is scored against the technology
  the world economy on average operates with rather than added on top of a 1990
  trend that already priced it in, so it differentiates nations instead of
  inflating all of them by the same amount
- **Convergence separated from diffusion**: two different things that were once
  conflated. Income catch-up — capital deepening and reallocation — stays in
  `economy.rs` where it always was. Technological adoption is paid on technology
  a nation actually puts into service, not on how far behind it is, so a country
  that learns nothing is no longer paid as though it were catching up. The cost
  floor now falls away as a technology approaches universal, which is what lets a
  small poor economy pick up ordinary things it could previously never afford
- **Political capital** exists as a currency (see below)
- **Statecraft — the namesake system**: mutual defence pacts with an upkeep both
  signatories pay, patronage as a standing share of the patron's output, trade
  dependency that accumulates and then becomes leverage, covert action that is
  deniable until it is caught. Every one of its seven commands is priced in
  political capital, and the acts that amount to breaking your word — renouncing
  a guarantee, cutting a client loose, tearing up a treaty — are charged to
  bankruptcy rather than refused, because a government can always renege

## Known calibration gap: the whole world is about twice too large

Measured on the default seed, clean builds, `run 35 1990`:

| | 1990 | sim 2025 | real 2025 (1990 $) | sim CAGR | real CAGR |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| USA | $5,980bn | $30,762bn | ~$14,000bn | 4.8% | 2.5% |
| Japan | $3,140bn | $13,742bn | ~$4,300bn | 4.3% | 0.9% |

Every mature economy *reads* about 2% growth in the 2025 table, because growth
has decayed by then — the excess is accumulated earlier in the run and never
given back. Japan is the worst case but it is not a Japan problem: the United
States is 2.2 points a year too fast over 35 years, and 2.2 points is almost
exactly the technology tree's productivity cap of +0.020.

That is the first place to look. `apply_bonuses` caps the whole technological
contribution at two points of annual trend growth, and if the leaders are
sitting at the cap for most of the run then the cap is doing all the work and
the tree is inflating everyone rather than differentiating them — which is the
precise failure the productivity rework was meant to prevent. Check whether the
leaders saturate it, and for how long, before touching anything else.

Nothing guards this. `china_growth_miracle` asserts a floor (>6x in 30 years)
and every other calibration test is about a *relative* outcome, so a world that
uniformly doubles passes all of them. A test that locks the frontier economy's
35-year trajectory would have caught it years of game-time earlier.

## Known calibration gap: output ignores labour

Growth is `TFP + investment effect + catch-up - drags`. Population appears only
through GDP per head, which feeds the development proxy — and that proxy is
already capped at 1.0 for every rich nation. So **population growth has no
effect whatever on the output of a developed economy**: the demographic
transition added in economy.rs makes Japan's population decline correctly and
changes its GDP by exactly zero.

That is why Japan still reads $7.2tn growing 2.7% in 2025 and stays ahead of
China, when the real figures are roughly $4.3tn, ~0.9%/yr, and overtaken in
2010. `japans_bubble_becomes_a_lost_decade` only guards the ten years after the
peak, so the long-run miss is currently untested.

The fix is the labour term SPEC section 3 already calls for: growth accounting
says output growth is TFP plus a capital contribution plus roughly 0.6 times
labour-force growth. Adding it makes a shrinking workforce cost output, which
is most of Japan's story — but it also hands every high-fertility poor nation a
growth bonus, so the catch-up term has to be rebalanced against it in the same
change. Do not land one half without the other.

## Next (rough priority)

### 1. Blocked on a decision, not on work
- **`feat/financial-system`** — currencies, FX regimes, contagion. `WorldState.finance`
  covers only the original 16 nations and `fin()` panics on the rest, so seven new
  nations and Ukraine need transcribed 1990 balance sheets (stance, reserves,
  FX debt, openness, hot money, risk) and Ukraine needs one created at birth.
  Partial work exists: currency and region arms for all eight, plus `Region::LatinAmerica`
  and `Region::Africa`.

### 2. The tree is invisible
253 technologies and the browser UI does not mention one of them. The owner's
stated preference is to see the game; this is the largest gap between what the sim
knows and what the screen shows.

### 3. Political capital — half done
The currency exists. Every nation holds a stock, seated from the order it keeps
and the prices it holds, earned by delivering growth and lost to recession and
war exhaustion; every player command is priced against it, and one that cannot be
afforded is refused rather than quietly applied. It is visible in the CLI
briefing, the headless report and the browser panel.

What is missing is the other half of SPEC's sentence: *every system* is meant to
be a buyer. Statecraft is — all seven of its commands are priced — but the AI
still is not, because `politics.rs` and `war.rs` move state directly instead of
going through the command queue, so it neither earns nor spends. Routing the AI's own decisions — the fiscal and
monetary rules, and above all the decision to go to war — through the same
pricing is what would make it bite for everyone. That is a real change to how
those systems are written, and it will move emergent history, so it wants its own
branch and its own calibration pass.

### 4. Harvested from `feat/tech-eras`, deferred (tag `archive/tech-eras`)
The scalar model was retired in favour of the tree, but two of its ideas were not
ported and are worth their own branches:
- **Live era rotation.** `Era` is a static calibration bracket. It should be a
  paradigm the world passes through, opening on a frontier threshold rather than a
  date, with a vigour curve so a fresh paradigm is fertile and an exhausted one is
  not.
- **Human capital.** `absorptive_capacity` reads development, openness, the command
  penalty and sanctions — but not schooling.

### 5. Known modelling gap: the tail of the roster
Growth for the smallest and poorest states is the least trustworthy part of the
model. The tree now lets them absorb ordinary technology instead of nothing at
all, but a nation the size of Bosnia is carried almost entirely by the income
catch-up term and the investment term, with the tree contributing little either
way. Sanctioned and post-war states swing hard between runs — Iraq rebounding at
double digits after an embargo lifts is the clearest case. Nothing here is wrong
enough to name a bug; it is simply where the model is thinnest, and it is worth
knowing that before reading any single small nation's numbers as a result.

### 6. Known modelling gap: Japan
Japan carries the highest transcribed 1990 trend of any nation and nothing ever
takes it away, so it settles near 2.8% and outgrows the United States for the whole
run. The lost decade is modelled as a bubble hangover rather than the permanent
break it was. Wants a demographic or balance-sheet mechanism.

### 7. Two domains have rival implementations
`feat/tech-biotech` and `feat/tech-transport` hold uncommitted second versions —
32 biotech techs against the 29 merged, 27 transport against 26, sharing only about
five ids with what is on master. Someone has to pick, or merge the best of both.

### 8. Later
Hourly-cadence scheduler, WASM, multiplayer spheres.

## Housekeeping

**Every worktree shares one cargo target directory.** `.cargo/config.toml` is
tracked, so a worktree checked out under `.claude/worktrees/` inherits
`target-dir = C:/Users/ridge/.cargo-target/spheres` and builds into the same place
as everything else. Combined with OneDrive resetting mtimes, cargo will happily
serve a test binary built from another branch's source — green tests that never ran
your code. When testing a worktree, set `CARGO_TARGET_DIR` to something else, and
if a result looks impossible, check the binary before you believe it.

OneDrive also holds locks on `.git/worktrees/*` and the worktree directories, so
`git worktree remove` and `git worktree prune` fail with "Permission denied" and
the branches those worktrees hold cannot be deleted. Pausing sync should clear it.
